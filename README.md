Chess-Vanilla-JS

A lightweight chess game built entirely with vanilla JavaScript. This project focuses on implementing core chess mechanics, including legal piece movement and special moves like en passant. While the game currently lacks checkmate and check detection, it provides a solid base for playing multiplayer games offline.

Features

Multiplayer (Offline): Play chess against a friend locally.
Legal Move Validation: Pieces can only move according to chess rules.
En Passant: Special pawn capture move is implemented.
No Check/Checkmate: The game currently does not check for check or checkmate conditions.

Usage

Once the game is running:

Each player takes turns moving their pieces according to standard chess rules.
To move a piece, simply click on it, then click on the desired square.
The game supports all legal moves, including en passant.
Note: in progress

Built With

JavaScript (Vanilla): All game logic is implemented with pure JavaScript, without any external libraries.
HTML/CSS: Simple and clean front-end interface.
